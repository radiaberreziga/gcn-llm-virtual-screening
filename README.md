# GCN + LLM for Enhanced Virtual Screening

This repository contains the code and experiments from the paper:  
**"Combining GCN Structural Learning with LLM Chemical Knowledge for Enhanced Virtual Screening"**

## 📘 Abstract

We propose a novel virtual screening approach that combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for molecular structure learning with domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) to inject chemical knowledge. This hybrid method improves prediction performance for drug discovery tasks.
